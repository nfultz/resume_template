# Resume Template


This resume template is written in markdown. Markdown is easy to write and
is well-supported by github.


## Manual build

Run `markdown resume.md >resume.html`, then open the resulting html file in
firefox or chrome, and print it out.

## Auto build

This depends on the `chrome-headless-render-pdf` node package.

Once you have that, run

`make`

It will convert the Markdown to HTML, use headless chrome to render w/ style.css and print to pdf, and clean up on exit.

## Styling

Edit `style.css` and adjust as needed. Note the `print selectors` at the bottom.

Can use

```
<div class=break></div>
```

to force a page break.

## DevOps

  Also use AWS CodeBuild to generate the pdf and archive to S3 for each branch. Be sure
to enable SemVer on the artifacts for that feature to work. I recommend one branch / job application, with
the branch name being the company name.
